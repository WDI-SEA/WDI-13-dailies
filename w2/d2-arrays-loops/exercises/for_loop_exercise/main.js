// DIRECTIONS: Create a new code snippet on repl.it for each problem

/*
	The syntax for a for-loop looks like this:
	for(var i = 0; i < x; i+= 1) {
		console.log(i);
	}
*/

// Step 1: Create a for-loop that will print to the console
// the numbers 1 to 10 (including 10)

// Step 2: Create a for-loop that will print to the console
// the numbers 10 to 20 (including 20)

// Step 3: Create a for-loop that will print 'even' to the console 
// for even numbers and 'odd' to the console for odd numbers for
// all numbers between 1 and 100 (including 100)
