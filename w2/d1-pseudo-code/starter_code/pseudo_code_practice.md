# Pseudocode a Real-Life Problem

Break into small groups and pick one of the following programs to pseudo-code:

#### Option 1: A Trivia Game

The game should have a preset list of questions, which are shown one at a time to the user. The user submits an answer and goes to the next question. After each question, they can see whether they were correct or incorrect. They can also see their total score.

#### Option 2: Concentration

The user should see a grid of cards. Clicking a card reveals it and allows the user to click another card. If they match, the cards stay up, and if not, they flip back over. Users get a point for every pair they flip. The game ends after one minute or all cards have been matched.

#### Option 3: Flash Cards

The user should start with a shuffled list of pre-existing cards. They can go back and forth between cards, and 'flip' the flash card to go from back-to-front or front-to-back.

Optionally, users may mark a card 'correct' if they know the answer on the back of the flash card, in which case it's temporarily removed from the deck.

#### Option 4: War (Card Game)

Users can play the [Game of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)) against a computer. The game continues until one player runs out of cards.

#### Timing & Review

- Students should work in pairs to pseudocode the first problem of their choosing (10 minutes).
- After time is up, they should 'swap' code with another team and review each other's code, leaving feedback (5 minutes).
- If time permits, switch teams and tackle an option that neither partner has yet attempted (10 minutes).
- Repeat the the review process (5 minutes).
