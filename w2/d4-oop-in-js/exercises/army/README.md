# Create Your Own Army

You are going to take over the JavaScript world with a new army of soldier objects.

In the [main.js](main.js) file, create a new soldier constructor function that allows you to create soldiers.

- A soldier should be able to have a name and number.
- The default type of a solder should be 'foot-soldier'.
- The soldier's number should sequentially increase.
- Each soldier in the army should have the same battleCry, an alert of "FREEDOM!"
- Your army should have a general whose type is 'general'.
- Your general's number should be incremented in line with your foot-solders.

Try copying/pasting your code into your console and checking to make sure that everything works!
