# JavaScript Stack Challenge

In computer science, a stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added. -- [Stack (abstract data type),Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_\(abstract_data_type\))

The goal of this exercise is to practice writing prototype methods. As a reminder of how we use prototypes, we've provided starter code, including a constructor function and one completed prototype method. Your task will be to complete the remaining method.

## Instructions

Create a custom JavaScript object modeling a stack using a constructor function and a prototype. Starter code has been provided in `stack.js`.

## Requirements

-   You should be able to create a new stack with `var stack = new Stack();`.
-   Your stack should have two methods, `push()` and `pop()`.

    -   `push()` adds a new value to the stack's storage.
    -   `pop()` removes the most recently added value from the stack's storage and returns it.

-   You should not use `Array.prototype.push()` or `Array.prototype.pop()`.

### Pre-fill the stack on instantiation:

```js
var stack = new Stack(1, 2, 3);
stack.pop(); //=> 3
```

### Allow `push` to chain:

```js
var stack = new Stack();
stack.push(1).push(2).push(3);
stack.pop(); //=> 3
```

Which parts of each method are side effects, and which are the "main" effect?
