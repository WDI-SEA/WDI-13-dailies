## Instructions

1. Right now, the `nav` element scrolls with the rest of the page. Add styles to turn the `nav` into a "sticky" (or "fixed") `nav.'

2. Find `diag-1,' `diag-2,' and `diag-3` in your HTML file. We want these to serve as labels for different parts of the insect. Position each label within the `.bug-wrapper,` following the image in the section below as a guide.
