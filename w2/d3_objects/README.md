## Intro to Objects (15 mins)

In this lesson, our focus is objects, an exciting aspect of JavaScript that ties into many of the concepts you've already learned.

Once you get to know objects, you'll realize how much easier your coding life can be.

> Check: Think/Pair/Share: Ask students to define, explain, or recall anything they already know about objects.


#### The limitations of arrays
So far, we've learned about fairly simple data types: strings, numbers, Booleans, and arrays.

However, as our applications become more complex, we need more structure in our code.

The arrays we've seen so far store and manage their elements by their indices.

This is a convenient way of managing elements, but it also has some disadvantages.

#### Easier access to data

Objects are often called **associative arrays**, as they associate keys with values.

As you start building applications, you'll encounter many situations where you'll want to associate keys with values.

Objects are extremely useful when we want to easily access data.

Let's take a look at an example where it would be helpful to associate keys with values to easily access data.


Let's say we are developing a fantasy football website. Using a regular array, we would store each player's info like so:

```js
var player = ["Aaron", "Rodgers", 12, 32];
```

There are only a handful of values in this array, but there is no context for any of them.

Is 12 the number of touchdowns that the player has scored? Or is it the number of years he's played in the NFL?

It's difficult to tell because we have no clear references for each data point.

Take a look at how we could represent the player with an object. Don't worry about syntax for now; we'll cover that soon. Just use the following example to get a feel for how to associate keys with values.

```js
var player = {
  firstName: "Aaron",
  lastName: "Rodgers",
  jerseyNumber: 12,
  age: 32
};
```

By associating keys with values, we can more accurately represent our player object.

Now we know at a glance what 12 is &mdash; our player's jersey number!

#### Objects - What are they good for?
Objects serve two main purposes in JavaScript:

1.  They act as a simple, structured data store. And, while they are similar to arrays, they access values using keys instead of indices.
3.  They provide a fundamental programming paradigm that helps us structure and categorize code. We'll explore this programming paradigm, known as Object Oriented Programming, in a future lesson.

In JavaScript, every physical thing can be represented as an object.

For example, if we're working on an airline booking site, we can represent how many seats are both open and booked on any given flight.

<img src="http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4577/Delta-Slide_20.png" width="300px">

On the airline site, we can also represent the customers booking those seats as objects, each with a first and last name, country of residency, birthdate, and so on.

## Properties and Methods - An Overview (15 mins)

Each object can also have its own **properties** and **methods**.


#### Properties
First, let's explore **properties**.

**Properties** are characteristics associated with an object.

If a variable is part of an object, it becomes a property. In other words, properties tell us about an object.

Let's look at another example:

If you were to describe a motorcycle, you might include its color, make, model, max speed, and year.

Each property has a name and a value, and each name/value pair tells us something about that individual object.

<img src="http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4563/Slide-20-Chart.svg" width="500px">

#### Methods
Let's focus on methods.

If a function is part of an object, it becomes a **method**.

Methods are used to represent how people interact with an object in the real world. In other words, **methods** are the actions that can be performed on objects.

We can use methods to:

1.  Retrieve the values of an object's properties to find out something about that object.
3.  Update the values of an object's properties.

Consider our motorcycle example. The following actions are common ways that humans interact with motorcycles:

We can use methods to retrieve the values of an object's properties (such as the motorcycle's model) or change its properties (such as when we start, stop, brake, or accelerate our bike).

<img src="http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4518/Slide-23-Chart.svg" width="500px">


#### Paired Practice:

1. In pairs, spend two minutes thinking about what attributes (properties) a WDI student should have (think of at least five!) and write them down.
2. Take two minutes to write down the methods the student should have.
3. Bonus: Think of a property for our student that might contain an array of data.

> Instructor Note: Whiteboard ideas from each pair.

## Creating Objects (15 mins)
We kicked off this lesson with a look at how objects can be used to connect keys with values in JavaScript. If you remember, we saw how each object can also have its own associated properties and methods.

Now let's explore how we can add properties and methods when creating objects.

#### Object Literal Notation
First, we'll learn how to create an object using **literal notation**.

Let's say we want to create objects for several popular superheros, starting with Superman.

We might want to add some properties for Superman: a first name, last name, and a superhero name.

We might also want to add a method to our Superman object which will return Superman's real first and last name (`Clark` and `Kent`), followed by his superhero name (`Superman`).


Here's how we would write this object using literal notation:

```js
var superman = {
  // Properties
  firstName: "Clark",
  lastName: "Kent",
  superheroName: "Superman",

  // Methods
  revealIdentity: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.superheroName;
  }
};
```

Let's look at the syntax breakdown:


*   Our object is contained within curly braces `{ }`.
*   We are storing our object in a variable, called `superman`.
*   We separate each key from its value using a `:`.
*   To add a property, we use a property name, such as `firstName`, `lastName`, or `superheroName`, followed by a `:`, followed by the corresponding value: `'Clark'`, `'Kent'`, or `'Superman'`.
*   To add a method, we would use the method name `revealIdentity`, followed by a `:`, followed by an anonymous function (`function (){}`).


#### This - A brief Overview


In the context of our objects, `this` is used in place of the object name to refer to the current object instance.


In a method, `this` refers to the object containing the function.


For example, in the function below, `this` refers to the animal object that contains the function/method `makeNoise`.

```js
var animal = {
  name: 'Rover',
  species: 'dog',
  breed: 'Golden Retriever',
  noise: 'bark!',
  makeNoise: function () {
    console.log(this.noise);
  }
};
```



Because `this` refers to the `animal` object, using it would be the same as writing out:

```js
console.log(animal.noise);
```

In our Superman example, within the function, we can use the `this` keyword to access different properties for our object.

For example, we can use `this.firstName` to access the value for the `firstName` property (in this case, 'Clark').


#### Check:

- What does `this` refer to in the following scenario, and why?
- What will be logged to the console?


```js
var paintbrush = {
  tool: 'paintbrush',
  brand: 'Winsor & Newton',
  price: 12.23,
  pattern: 'zig zag',
  drawShape: function () {
    console.log(this.pattern);
  }
};
```

> Answer: `this` refers to the `paintbrush` object.
> 
> The console will log: `'zig zag'`.

#### Exercise:

Let's practice!

1.  Create an object called `currentlyReading`.
2.  Add the following properties to the object:

<a name="dot-notation"></a>
## Dot Notation (10 mins)

#### Accessing Properties Using Dot Notation
Now, let's turn to accessing properties.

We can _get_ and _set_ object properties using either **dot notation** or **square bracket syntax**.

**Dot notation** is common for simple scenarios.

Remember the syntax we used when learning about arrays to find out the length of an array?

```js
var fruits = ["blueberries", "strawberries", "apples"];
fruits.length; => 3
```

By using our array name, followed by `.length`, we were able to access the length property of our array.

This is the dot `.` notation.

<img src="http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4528/Slide-12-Fruit.svg" width="300px">

We can access values using the object name, followed by a period `.`, followed by the name of the property we want to access.

Here, we've created the variables `heroFirstName` and `heroLastName` to store the information we want to retrieve.

```js
// Store 'Clark' in the heroFirstName variable.
var heroFirstName = superman.firstName;  

// Store 'Kent' in the heroLastName variable.
var heroLastName = superman.lastName; 
```
#### Updating Properties Using Dot Notation
We can also update values using dot notation.

To do so, we use the name of the object (in this case, `superhero`), followed by the name of the property we want to update (in this case, `.firstName` or `.lastName`).

We then use the assignment operator (`=`) followed by the new value.

```js
superhero.firstName = 'Susan';
superhero.lastName = 'Storm';
```

#### Adding New Properties
The syntax we use to update a property can also add a new one. If the property we are trying to update doesn't yet exist, it will be added automatically.

```js
superhero.favoriteFood = 'Beef Bourguignon';
```

We've now added a new favorite food for Superman!



#### Exercise:

Let's practice!

Consider the following object:

```js
var pet = {
  species: 'iguana',
  gender: 'female',
  age: 12,
  name: 'Godzilla'
};
```

1. What code could we write to retrieve the value for `name` from the object and store this value in a variable `petName`?
2. Now, how would you assign `13` as the value for `age`?
3. How would you add a new property, `'favoriteFood'` using the value `'crickets'`?

> _(Answers: 1.`var petName = pet.name;`  2.`pet.age = 13;`  3.`pet.favoriteFood = 'crickets';` )_

---
<a name="square-bracket-notation"></a>
## Square Bracket Notation (10 mins)
Let's go back to our superhero example.

To access values, we can also use **square bracket syntax** to access and update the properties for an object.

```js
// Store 'Clark' in the heroFirstName variable.
var heroFirstName = superman['firstName'];

// Store 'Kent' in the heroLastName variable.
var heroLastName = superman['lastName'];
```

Once again, the name of our object is `superman`, followed by the property name, contained within quotes and square brackets.

The square bracket syntax is commonly used when a variable name is used in place of a property name:

```js
var propertyName = 'firstName';
var supermanFirst = superman[propertyName];   => 'Clark'
```

#### Square Bracket vs. Dot Notation
Dot notation can only work with the _exact literal name of the property_, since you can't type something like `superman.'firstName'` or `superman.yourVariableName`, while the square brackets allow for substituting in the value of a string or variable in place of the property name.

Let's update the `firstName` and `lastName` of our object again, but using the square bracket syntax this time:

```js
superman['firstName'] = 'Susan';
superman['lastName'] = 'Storm';
```

As with dot notation, we use the name of the object, followed by the property name wrapped in quotes and square brackets (`[ ]`). Next, we use the assignment operator (`=`), followed by the new value.

Although dot notation is often a popular method, as it's slightly easier to write out, we'll need to use square bracket syntax anytime we are generating our property names dynamically, i.e., when we want to use a variable for a property name.

#### Exercise:

Now you try! Let's return to our pet, Godzilla.

Consider the following object:

```js
var pet = {
  species: 'iguana',
  gender: 'female',
  age: 12,
  name: 'Godzilla'
};
```

1. How would you retrieve the value for `name` from the object, and store this value in a variable `petName` using square bracket syntax `[ ]`?
2. How would you assign `13` as the value for `age` using square bracket syntax `[ ]`?
3. How would you add a new key, `favoriteFood`, with value `'crickets'` using square bracket syntax `[ ]`?

> _(Answers: 1.`var petName = pet['name'];`  2.`pet['age'] = 13;` 3.`pet['favoriteFood'] = 'crickets';`)

---
<a name="removing-properties"></a>
## Removing Properties (5 mins)
Excellent! Now, let's discuss how we can use the `delete` operator to remove a property from our object.

Here's what the syntax for deleting a property looks like (using the dot notation or the square bracket syntax):

```js
delete object.property      // Dot notation
delete object['property']   // Square bracket syntax
```

Here's an example:

```js
var superman = {
  // Properties
  firstName: "Clark",
  lastName: "Kent",
  superheroName: "Superman",

  // Method
  revealIdentity: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.superheroName;
  }
};
```

Dot Notation: `delete superman.firstName;`  
Square Bracket Notation: `delete superman['firstName'];`


---
<a name="accessing-methods"></a>
## Accessing Methods (5 mins)
Next, let's talk about accessing methods. We will use **dot notation** to access methods for our objects.

If we wanted to access — or call, our `revealIdentity` method — we could do so using the following syntax:

```js
var supermanIdentity = superman.revealIdentity(); 
=> 'Clark Kent is Superman'
```

1. Here, we use the object name `superman`, followed by a period, followed by the method name, followed by parenthesis.
2. We are saving the value that is returned in a variable, `supermanIdentity`, so we can reference it later.



---
<a name="iterating-through-objects"></a>
## Iterating through an Object (10 mins)

Like arrays, you can use a loop to iterate through an object. Say we want to print out all of an object's keys...

```js
// Iterate through object keys
for (attribute in superman) {
  console.log( attribute );
}
```

> Knowing this, how could we go about getting all the values in an object?

JavaScript objects also have native methods that take care of this for us...

```js
// .keys()
Object.keys(superman);
```

### Exercise:

Create a variable named `wdiStudent` and assign it to an object literal.

1. Give your student at least three properties.
2. One must contain an array or object.
3. Update two properties, using square bracket notation to update one and dot notation to update the other.
4. Give your student a new property using dot or bracket notation.
5. Delete one attribute.
6. Iterate through and print out all of the student's key-value pairs.

**Bonus:** Write a function that returns your `wdiStudent` object.

<a name="nested-collections"></a>
## Nested Collections (5 mins) - If time permits

Object properties aren't limited to simple data types. We can also nest collections inside of collections.

```js
var car = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Civic",
  year: 1997,

  // An array within an object.
  gears: ["Reverse", "Neutral", "1", "2", "3", "4"],

  // An object within an object.
  engine: {
    horsepower: "6 horses",
    pistons: 12,
    fast: true,
    furious: false
  }
};
```

> Check: In the above examples, how do we access...
> 
> * "Neutral" (i.e., array value within an object)?
> * "6 horses" (i.e., object value within an object)?

## Conclusion (5 mins)
- Review Meal Tracker solution.
- Recap topic(s) covered in today's lesson.

In this lesson, we took a look at how we can store data in a way that models real-life using objects.

Objects are a type of data structure that is nearly universal across programming languages, although they may have different names in different languages (in Python, they're called a dictionary; in Ruby, they're called Hashes).

Understanding and being able to manipulate and access values in objects is a skill that will not only come in handy when writing JavaScript &mdash; but can be applied to many other programming lanugages.
