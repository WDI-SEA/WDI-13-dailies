#Bodyshop Part 2

Cars are great and all, but now it's time to extend this system and make it handle more types of vehicles.

## Requirements

###Part 1 &mdash; Trucks

Create a new constructor called `Truck` that inherits `Car`.

This should be done in the file called `Truck.js`, which requires `Car.js` for you to use.

Your `Truck` constructor should meet the following requirements.

* Must be an instance of `Truck`.
* Must be an instance of `Car`.
* Must have the following constructor parameters:
  * Make
  * Model
  * Year
  * Color
  * Passengers
* Must default to three seats.

###Part 2 -- Motorcycles

Create a new constructor called `Motorcycle` that inherits your `Car` constructor.

This should be done in the file called `Motorcycle.js`, which requires `Car.js` for you to use.

Your `Motorcycle` constructor should meet the following requirements.

* Must be an instance of a `Motorcycle`.
* Must be an instance of a `Car`.
* Must have the following parameters:
  * Make
  * Model
  * Year
  * Color
  * Passengers
* Must default to two seats.
* Must be able to do a wheelie by calling `wheelie()`, but only if running.
  * If the wheelie is successful, return `true` and `console.log` the following: `"Doing a sick wheelie!!"`. Otherwise, return `false`.
  * This function should be attached to `Motorcycle.prototype`.
