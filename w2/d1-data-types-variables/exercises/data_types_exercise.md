## Data Types

What is the return value of each of the below code snippets? After coming up with each answer, test it out in the console.

```js
typeof( 15 );
// Include your answer below each line using a comment, like this.
// Then, include the actual output of the command entered, in this case, the output of typeof( 15 );

typeof( 5.5 );
typeof( NaN );
typeof( "hello" );
typeof( true )
typeof( 1 != 2 );

"hamburger" + "s";
"hamburgers" - "s";
"1" + "3"
"1" - "3"
"johnny" + 5;
"johnny" - 5
99 * "luftbaloons";
```

What's going on in the second half of the previous question? What "rules," if any, can we pull from those examples?
